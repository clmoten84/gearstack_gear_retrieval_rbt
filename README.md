# Gearstack Gear Retrieval Bot

This bot is used to search for and retrieve gear to add to the Gearstack
application database. This automation keeps Gearstack application
database up to date with new music gear added to certain music equipment
websites.

This is a pretty cool example of how to use the Amazon PAAPI to create a product catalog database for affiliate marketing websites.
